Lightwalk is a lightweight CPU-driven SDF (signed distance field) rust crate.

Why you might want to use this crate:
- The ability to define SDFs in a expressive manner by leveraging the language's type system in a similar manner to the standard library's
iterators.
- SDF composition is achieved through zero cost abstractions, meaning that _generally_, the SDF that is generated by compositing and
transforming sub SDFs should be as performant as if the complete SDF was written and optimized by-hand.
- The crate can be stripped down from it's dependencies to minimise it's footprint. The only _required_ crate is `num`.
- Provides _optional_ dependencies like `glam` that can make integration in codebases smoother. This is required for certain features, like 3d
rotations.
- Basic CPU-based sphere-casting.
